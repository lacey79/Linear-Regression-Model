# Linear-Regression-Model
In this project, I loaded the Boston Housing dataset, split the data into training and testing sets, trained a linear regression model on the training set, and evaluated the model's performance on the testing set. The goal of this project was to predict housing prices based on a set of features such as crime rate, number of rooms, and accessibility to highways.

This project was a step in my journey to improve my skills in machine learning and data analysis. I am continuously exploring and learning new techniques and methods to stay up-to-date with the latest developments in the field.
